PID/(Q)EAA Issuance
+++++++++++++++++++

This section describes the PID and (Q)EAAs issuance flow with an high level of security.
The relevant entities and interfaces involved in the issuance flow are:

    - *Wallet Provider*: The entity responsible for releasing an EUDI Wallet Solution. The Wallet Provider issues the Wallet Attestations to its Wallet Instances through an Attestation Service. The Wallet Attestation certifies the genuinity and authenticity of the Wallet Instance and its compliance with the security and privacy requirements.
    - *Wallet Solution*: Entire product and service owned by a Wallet Provider, offered to all the Users and certified as EUDI-compliant by a Conformity Assessment Body (CAB).
    - *Wallet Instance*: Instance of a Wallet Solution, installed on the User device. The Wallet Instance provides graphical interfaces for User interaction with Relying Parties, PID, (Q)EAA Providers and the Wallet Provider.
    - *PID Provider*: The entity that issues the eIDAS Person Identification Data (PID). It is composed of:

        - OpenID4VCI Component: based on the "OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance" specification  [`OpenID4VCI`_] to release the PID.
        - National eID Relying Party: The component to authenticate the User with the national Digital Identity Providers, based on OpenID Connect Core 1.0 or SAML2.

    - *National Identity Provider*: It represents preexisting identity systems based on SAML2 or OpenID Connect Core 1.0, already in production in each Member State (eg: the Italian SPID and CIE id schemes notified eIDAS with *LoA* **High**, see `SPID/CIE OpenID Connect Specifications <https://italia.github.io/spid-cie-oidc-docs/en/>`_).

    - *(Q)EAA Provider*: It represents the Issuer of (Q)EAAs. It is composed with the following components:

      - OpenID4VCI Component: based on the "OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance" specification to release (Q)EAAs.
      - Relying Party: Component to authenticate the User with the PID. The (Q)EAA Provider acts as a Verifier by sending a presentation request to the Wallet Instance, according to [`OpenID4VP`_]. The Wallet Instance MUST have a valid PID, obtained in a previous time, to get authenticated with the (Q)EAA Provider.

High-Level PID flow
-------------------

The :numref:`fig_High-Level-Flow-ITWallet-PID-Issuance` shows a general architecture and highlights the main operations involved in the issuance of a PID.

    PID Issuance - General architecture and high level flow.

Below the description of the steps represented in the previous picture:

    0. **Wallet Instance Setup**: the first time the Wallet Instance is started a preliminary setup phase is carried out. It consists of the release of the Wallet Attestation issued by Wallet Attestation Service asserting the genuineness and the compliance of the Wallet Instance with the shared trust framework. The Wallet Attestation binds the public key provided by the Wallet Instance, related to one of the private keys generated by the Wallet Instance.
    1. **PID/(Q)EAA Provider Discovery**: the Wallet Instance discovers the trusted Digital Credential Issuers using the Federation API (e.g.: using the Subordinate Listing Endpoint of the Trust Anchor and its Intermediates), inspecting the Credential Issuer metadata and Trust Marks for filtering the PID Provider.
    2. **PID Provider Metadata**: the Wallet Instance establishes the trust to the PID Provider according to the Trust Model and obtains the Metadata that discloses the formats of the PID, the algorithms supported, and any other parameter required for interoperability needs.
    3. **PID Request**: using the Authorization Code Flow defined in [`OpenID4VCI`_] the Wallet Instance requests the PID to the PID Provider.
    4. **User Authentication**: the PID Provider authenticates the User with LoA High, acting as an Identity and Access Management Proxy to the National eID system.
    5. **PID Issuance**: the User is authenticated with LoA High and the PID Provider releases a PID bound to the key material held by the requesting Wallet Instance.

In the following sections the steps from 1 to 5 are further expanded into more technical details.

High-Level (Q)EAA flow
----------------------

The :numref:`fig_High-Level-Flow-ITWallet-QEAA-Issuance` shows a general architecture and highlights the main operations involved in the issuance of a (Q)EAA, following the assumptions listed below:

  - the User has a valid PID stored in their own Wallet Instance;
  - the (Q)EAA requires a high security implementation profile.

    :align: center

    (Q)EAA Issuance - General architecture and high level flow

Below the description of the most relevant operations involved in the (Q)EAA issuance:

    1. **Discovery of the trusted (Q)EAA Provider**: the Wallet Instance obtains the list of the trusted (Q)EAA Provider using the Federation API (e.g.: using the Subordinate Listing Endpoint of the Trust Anchor and its Intermediates), then inspects the metadata and Trust Mark looking for the Digital Credential capabilities of each (Q)EAA Provider.
    2. **(Q)EAA Provider Metadata**: the Wallet Instance establishes the trust to the (Q)EAA Provider according to the Trust Model, obtaining the Metadata that discloses the formats of the (Q)EAA, the algorithms supported, and any other parameter required for interoperability needs.
    3. **(Q)EAA Request**: using the Authorization Code Flow , defined in [`OpenID4VCI`_], the Wallet Instance requests a (Q)EAA to the (Q)EAA Provider.
    4. **User Authentication**: the (Q)EAA Provider, acting as a Verifier (Relying Party), authenticates the User evaluating the presentation of the PID.
    5. **(Q)EAA Issuance**: the User is authenticated with a valid PID and the (Q)EAA Provider releases a (Q)EAA bound to the key material held by the requesting Wallet Instance.


Low-Level Issuance Flow
-----------------------

The PID/(Q)EAA Issuance flow is based on [`OpenID4VCI`_] and the following main reference standards/specifications MUST be supported on top of `OpenID4VCI`_: 

  * **The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework** [:rfc:`6749`], as recommended in Section 3 of [`OpenID4VCI`_]. 
  * **Pushed Authorization Requests** (PAR) [:rfc:`9126`], as recommended in Section 5 of [`OpenID4VCI`_].
  * **Proof Key for Code Exchange** (PKCE)  [:rfc:`7636`], as recommended in Section 5 of [`OpenID4VCI`_].
  * **JWT Authorization Requests** (JAR) [:rfc:`9101`].
  * **JWT Authorization Response Modes** (JARM) [`OAUTH-V2-JARM-04`_]. 
  * **Rich Authorization Requests** (RAR) [:rfc:`9396`].
  * **OAuth 2.0 Attestation-Based Client Authentication** [`OAUTH-ATTESTATION-CLIENT-AUTH`_].
  * **OpenID Federation 1.0** [`OID-FED`_].

The PID/(Q)EAA Provider MUST use *OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server* based on :rfc:`6749` to authorize the User to obtain a Credential. PID/(Q)EAA Providers MUST support 

  * **Authorization Code Flow**: The PID/(Q)EAA Provider requires User authentication and consent at the Authorization Endpoint before collecting User information to create and provide a Credential.
  * **Wallet Initiated Flow**: The request from the Wallet Instance is sent to the PID/(Q)EAA Provider without any input from the latter.
  * **Same-device Issuance flow**: The User receives the Credential on the same device that initiated the flow. 
  * **Immediate Issuance flow**: The PID/(Q)EAA Provider issues the Credential directly in response to the Credential Request.
  * **Deferred Issuance flow**: The PID/(Q)EAA Provider may require time to issue the requested Digital Credential, due to the Authentic Sources data provisioning rules, and allows the Wallet to retrieve the requested Credential in the future.

    PID/(Q)EAA Issuance - Detailed flow


**Steps 1-4 (Discovery):** The User, using the Wallet Instance, selects the PID/(Q)EAA Provider from those listed in the list of trustworthy entities. The Wallet Instance then processes the Metadata for the selected PID/(Q)EAA Provider as defined in the `Trust Model section <https://italia.github.io/eudi-wallet-it-docs/versione-corrente/en/trust.html#trust-evaluation-mechanism>`_ of this specification.

.. note::

    **Federation Check:** The Wallet Instance must verify whether the PID/(Q)EAA Provider is a member of the Federation, obtaining its protocol specific Metadata. A non-normative example of a response from the endpoint **.well-known/openid-federation** with the **Entity Configuration** and the **Metadata** of the PID/(Q)EAA Provider is represented within the section :ref:`Entity Configuration of PID/(Q)EAA Providers`.

**Steps 5-6 (PAR Request)**: The Wallet Instance:

  * creates a fresh PKCE code verifier, Wallet Attestation Proof of Possession, and ``state`` parameter for the *Pushed Authorization Request*.
  * provides to the PID/(Q)EAA Provider PAR endpoint the parameters previously listed above, using the ``request`` parameter (hereafter Request Object) according to :rfc:`9126` Section 3 to prevent Request URI swapping attack.
  * MUST create the ``code_verifier`` with enough entropy random string using the unreserved characters with a minimum length of 43 characters and a maximum length of 128 characters, making it impractical for an attacker to guess its value. The value MUST be generated following the recommendation in Section 4.1 of :rfc:`7636`.
  * signs this request using the private key that is created during the setup phase to obtain the Wallet Attestation. The related public key that is attested by the Wallet Provider is provided within the Wallet Attestation ``cnf`` claim.
  * MUST use the ``OAuth-Client-Attestation`` and  ``OAuth-Client-Attestation-PoP`` parameters according to OAuth 2.0 Attestation-based Client Authentication [`OAUTH-ATTESTATION-CLIENT-AUTH`_], since in this flow the Pushed Authorization Endpoint is a protected endpoint.
  * specifies the types of the requested credentials using the ``authorization_details`` [RAR :rfc:`9396`] parameter.

The PID/(Q)EAA Provider performs the following checks upon the receipt of the PAR request:

    1. It MUST validate the signature of the Request Object using the algorithm specified in the ``alg`` header parameter (:rfc:`9126`, :rfc:`9101`) and the public key retrieved from the Wallet Attestation (``cnf.jwk``) referenced in the Request Object, using the ``kid`` JWS header parameter.
    2. It MUST check that the used algorithm for signing the request in the ``alg`` header is one of the listed within the Section `Cryptographic Algorithms <algorithms.html>`_.
    3. It MUST check that the ``client_id`` in the request body of the PAR request matches the ``client_id`` claim included in the Request Object.
    4. It MUST check that the ``iss`` claim in the Request Object matches the ``client_id`` claim in the Request Object (:rfc:`9126`, :rfc:`9101`).
    5. It MUST check that the ``aud`` claim in the Request Object is equal to the PID/(Q)EAA Provider authorization endpoint uri (:rfc:`9126`, :rfc:`9101`).
    6. It MUST reject the PAR request, if it contains the ``request_uri`` parameter (:rfc:`9126`).
    7. It MUST check that the Request Object contains all the mandatory parameters which values are validated according to :ref:`Table of the HTTP parameters <table_request_object_claim>` [derived from :rfc:`9126`].
    8. It MUST check that the Request Object is not expired, checking the ``exp`` claim.
    9. It MUST check that the Request Object was issued in a previous time than the value exposed in the ``iat`` claim. It SHOULD reject the request if the ``iat`` claim is far from the current time (:rfc:`9126`) of more than `5` minutes.
    10. It MUST check that the ``jti`` claim in the Request Object has not been used before by the Wallet Instance identified by the ``client_id``. This allows the PID/(Q)EAA Provider to mitigate replay attacks (:rfc:`7519`).
    11. It MUST validate the ``OAuth-Client-Attestation-PoP`` parameter based on Section 4 of [`OAUTH-ATTESTATION-CLIENT-AUTH`_].

  :language: JSON

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/request-object-payload.json
  :language: JSON


.. note::

    **Federation Check**: The PID/(Q)EAA Provider MUST check that the Wallet Provider is part of the federation.


.. note::
   The PID/(Q)EAA Provider MUST validate the signature of the the Wallet Attestation and that it is not expired.


**Step 7 (PAR Response)**:  The PID/(Q)EAA Provider provides a one-time use ``request_uri`` value. The issued ``request_uri`` value must be bound to the client identifier (``client_id``) that was provided in the Request Object.


.. note::
    The entropy of the ``request_uri`` MUST be sufficiently large. The adequate shortness of the validity and the entropy of the ``request_uri`` depends on the risk calculation based on the value of the resource being protected. The validity time SHOULD be less than a minute, and the ``request_uri`` MUST include a cryptographic random value of 128 bits or more (:rfc:`9101`). The entire ``request_uri`` SHOULD NOT exceed 512 ASCII characters due to the following two main reasons (:rfc:`9101`):

        1. Many phones on the market still do not accept large payloads. The restriction is typically either 512 or 1024 ASCII characters.
        2. On a slow connection such as a 2G mobile connection, a large URL would cause a slow response; therefore, the use of such is not advisable from the user-experience point of view.

The PID/(Q)EAA Provider returns the issued ``request_uri`` to the Wallet Instance. A non-normative example of the response is shown below.

.. code-block:: http

    HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store
    Content-Type: application/json

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/par-response.json
  :language: JSON


**Steps 8-9 (Authorization Request)**: The Wallet Instance sends an authorization request to the PID/(Q)EAA Provider Authorization Endpoint. Since parts of this Authorization Request content, e.g., the ``code_challenge`` parameter value, are unique to a particular Authorization Request, the Wallet Instance MUST only use a ``request_uri`` value once (:rfc:`9126`); The  PID/(Q)EAA Provider performs the following checks upon the receipt of the Authorization Request:

    1. It MUST treat ``request_uri`` values as one-time use and MUST reject an expired request. However, it MAY allow for duplicate requests due to a user reloading/refreshing their user-agent (derived from :rfc:`9126`).
    2. It MUST identify the request as a result of the submitted PAR (derived from :rfc:`9126`).
    3. It MUST reject all the Authorization Requests that do not contain the ``request_uri`` parameter as the PAR is the only way to pass the Authorization Request from the Wallet Instance (derived from :rfc:`9126`).


.. code-block:: http

    GET /authorize?client_id=$thumprint-of-the-jwk-in-the-cnf-wallet-attestation$&request_uri=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Arequest_uri%3Abwc4JK-ESC0w8acc191e-Y1LTC2 HTTP/1.1
    Host: eaa-provider.example.org


.. note::

   **User Authentication and Consent**: The PID Provider performs the User authentication based on the requirements of eIDAS LoA High by means of national notified eIDAS scheme and requires the User consent for the PID issuance.
   The (Q)EAA Provider performs the User authentication requesting a valid PID to the Wallet Instance. The (Q)EAA Provider MUST use [`OpenID4VP`_] to dynamically request the presentation of the PID. From a protocol perspective, the (Q)EAA Provider acts as a Relying Party, providing the presentation request to the Wallet Instance. The Wallet Instance MUST have a valid PID obtained prior to start the transaction with the (Q)EAA Provider.


**Steps 10-11 (Authorization Response)**: The PID/(Q)EAA Provider sends an authorization ``code`` together with ``state`` and ``iss`` parameters to the Wallet Instance. The Wallet Instance performs the following checks on the Authorization Response:

    1. It MUST check the Authorization Response contains all the defined parameters according to :ref:`Table of the HTTP Response parameters <table_http_response_claim>`.
    2. It MUST check the returned value by the PID/(Q)EAA Provider for ``state`` parameter is equal to the value sent by Wallet Instance in the Request Object (:rfc:`6749`).
    3. It MUST check that the URL of PID/(Q)EAA Provider in ``iss`` parameter is equal to the URL identifier of intended PID/(Q)EAA Provider that the Wallet Instance start the communication with (:rfc:`9027`).

.. note::

    The Wallet Instance redirect URI is a universal or app link registered with the local operating system, so this latter will resolve it and pass the response to the Wallet Instance.

.. code-block:: http

    HTTP/1.1 302 Found

**Steps 12-13 (DPoP Proof for Token Endpoint)**: The Wallet Instance MUST create a new key pair for the DPoP and a fresh DPoP Proof JWT following the instruction provided in  the Section 4 of (:rfc:`9449`) for the token request to the PID/(Q)EAA Provider. The DPoP Proof JWT is signed using the private key for DPoP created by Wallet Instance for this scope. DPoP binds the Access Token to a certain Wallet Instance (:rfc:`9449`) and mitigates the misuse of leaked or stolen Access Tokens at the Credential Endpoint.

**Step 14 (Token Request):** The Wallet Instance sends a token request to the PID/(Q)EAA Provider Token Endpoint with a *DPoP Proof JWT* and the parameters: ``code``, ``code_verifier``, and OAuth 2.0 Attestation based Client Authentication  (``OAuth-Client-Attestation`` and ``OAuth-Client-Attestation-PoP``). 
The ``OAuth-Client-Attestation`` is signed using the private key that is created during the setup phase to obtain the Wallet Attestation. The related public key that is attested by the Wallet Provider is provided within the Wallet Attestation (``cnf`` claim). The PID/(Q)EAA Provider performs the following checks on the Token Request:

   1. It MUST ensure that the Authorization ``code`` is issued to the authenticated Wallet Instance (:rfc:`6749`) and was not replied.
   2. It MUST ensure the Authorization ``code`` is valid and has not been previously used (:rfc:`6749`).
   3. It MUST ensure the ``redirect_uri`` matches the value included in the previous Request Object (see Section 3.1.3.1. of [`OIDC`_]).
   4. It MUST validate the DPoP Proof JWT, according to (:rfc:`9449`) Section 4.3.

**Step 15 (Token Response)**: The PID/(Q)EAA Provider validates the request, if successful an *Access Token* (bound to the DPoP key) and a fresh `c_nonce` are provided by the Issuer to the Wallet Instance. The parameter `c_nonce` is a string value, which MUST be unpredictable and is used later by the Wallet Instance in Step 18 to create the proof of possession of the key (*proof* claim) and it is the primary countermeasure against key proof replay attack. Note that, the received `c_nonce` value can be used to create the proof as long as the Issuer provides the Wallet Instance with a new `c_nonce` value.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/at-dpop-header.json
  :language: JSON

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/at-dpop-payload.json
  :language: JSON


**Steps 16-17 (DPoP Proof for Credential Endpoint)**: The Wallet Instance for requesting the Digital Credential creates a proof of possession with ``c_nonce`` obtained in **Step 15** and using the private key used for the DPoP, signing a DPoP Proof JWT according to (:rfc:`9449`) Section 4. The ``jwk`` value in the ``proof`` parameter MUST be equal to the public key referenced in the DPoP.

**Step 18 (Credential Request)**: The Wallet Instance sends a request for the Digital Credential to the PID/(Q)EAA Credential endpoint. This request MUST include the Access Token, DPoP Proof JWT, credential type, proof (which demonstrates possession of the key), and format parameters. The proof parameter MUST be an object that contains evidence of possession of the cryptographic key material to which the issued PID/(Q)EAA Digital Credential will be bound. To verify the proof, the PID/(Q)EAA Provider conducts the following checks at the Credential endpoint:

 1. the JWT proof MUST include all required claims as specified in the table of Section :ref:`Token Request <sec_token_request>`;
 2. The key proof MUST be explicitly typed using header parameters as defined for the respective proof type;
 3. The header parameter alg MUST indicate a registered asymmetric digital signature algorithm, and MUST NOT be set to `none`;
 4. The signature on the key proof MUST be verified using the public key specified in the header parameter.
 5. The header parameter MUST NOT contain a private key.
 6. If a `c_nonce` value was previously provided by the server, the nonce claim in the JWT MUST match this `c_nonce` value. Furthermore, the creation time of the JWT, as indicated by the `iat` claim or a server-managed timestamp via the nonce claim, MUST be within an acceptable window of time as determined by the server.


.. note::

    **PID/(Q)EAA Credential Schema and Status registration**: The PID/(Q)EAA Provider MUST register all the issued Credentials for their later revocation, if needed.


.. note::

    It is RECOMMENDED that the public key contained in the ``jwt_proof`` be specifically generated for the requested Credential (fresh cryptographic key) to ensure that different issued Credentials do not share the same public key, thereby remaining unlinkable to each other.


A non-normative example of the Credential Request is provided below.

  :language: JSON  

**Steps 19-21 (Credential Response)**: The PID/(Q)EAA Provider MUST validate the *DPoP JWT Proof* based on the steps defined in Section 4.3 of (:rfc:`9449`) and whether the *Access Token* is valid and suitable for the requested PID/(Q)EAA. It also MUST validate the proof of possession for the key material the new credential SHALL be bound to, according to `OpenID4VCI`_ Section 7.2.2. If all checks succeed, the PID/(Q)EAA Provider creates a new Credential bound to the key material and provide it to the Wallet Instance. The Wallet Instance MUST perform the following checks before proceeding with the secure storage of the PID/(Q)EAA:

    1. It MUST check that the PID Credential Response contains all the mandatory parameters and values are validated according to :ref:`Table of the credential response parameters <table_credential_response_claim>`.
    2. It MUST check the PID integrity by verifying the signature using the algorithm specified in the ``alg`` header parameter of SD-JWT (:ref:`PID/(Q)EAA Data Model <pid_eaa_data_model.rst>`) and the public key that is identified using using the ``kid`` header of the SD-JWT.
    3. It MUST check that the received PID (in credential claim) matches the schema defined in :ref:`PID/(Q)EAA Data Model <pid_eaa_data_model.rst>`.
    4. It MUST process and verify the PID in SD-JWT VC format (according to `SD.JWT#Verification <https://drafts.oauth.net/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt.html#name-verification-and-processing>`_ Section 6.) or MDOC CBOR format. 
    5. It MUST verify the Trust Chain in the header of SD-JWT VC to verify that the PID Provider is trusted.

If the checks defined above are successful the Wallet Instance proceeds with the secure storage of the PID/(Q)EAA.

.. note::

  If the issuance of the requested Credential cannot be issued immediately and it requires more time to be issued, then the PID/(Q)EAA Provider MAY support the *Deferred Flow* (step 24) as specified in Section :ref:`Deferred Flow`.

**Steps 22 (Notification Request)**: According to Section 10.1 of [`OpenID4VCI`_], the Wallet sends an HTTP POST request to the Notification Endpoint using the *application/json* media type as in the following non-normative example.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/notification-request.json
  :language: JSON 


**Steps 23 (Notification Response)**: When the Credential Issuer has successfully received the Notification Request from the Wallet, it MUST respond with an HTTP status code *204* as recommended in Section 10.2 of [`OpenID4VCI`_]. Below is a non-normative example of response to a successful Notification Request:

.. code-block:: http

  HTTP/1.1 204 No Content



Deferred Flow
-------------

The PID/(Q)EAA Providers MAY support a *Deferred Flow* which has the aim of handling the cases where an immediate issuance is not possible for some reasons due to errors during the communication between the PID/(Q)EAA Provider and the Authentic Source (for example the Authentic Source is temporarily unavailable, etc.) or due to administrative or technical processes that do not allow the Credential to be provided immediately.


General Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 1. The Deferred Credential request MAY also happen several days after the initial Credential request. 
 2. The User MUST be informed that the Credential is available and ready to be issued.
 3. The Wallet Provider MUST NOT be informed about which Credential is available to be issued or which Credential Provider the User needs to contact. 
 4. The Wallet Instance MUST be informed about the amount of time to wait before making a new Credential request.
 5. As, in general, an unavailability may be an unexpected event, the PID/(Q)EAA Provider MUST be able to switch on the fly between a *immediate* and an *deferred* flow. This decision MUST be taken after the authorization step.

Technical Flow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If PID/(Q)EAA Providers, supporting this flow, are not able to immediately issue a requested Credential, they MUST provide the Wallet Instance with an HTTP Credential Response cointaining the amount of time to wait before making a new Credential request. The HTTP status code MUST be *202* (see Section 15.3.3 of [:rfc:`9110`]). Below a non-normative example is given.

.. code-block:: http

  HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
  Content-Type: application/json
  Cache-Control: no-store

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/credential-response-deferred.json
  :language: JSON  

The Wallet Instance MUST use the value given in the *lead_time* parameter to inform the User when the Credential becomes available (e.g. using a local notification triggered by the *lead_time* time value). PID/(Q)EAA Providers MAY send a notification to the User through a communication channel (e.g. email address), if available from the PID/(Q)EAA Provider.

Upon receipt of the notification (by the Wallet Instance and/or by the PID/(Q)EAA Provider), the User opens the Wallet Instance and start the Issuance Flow again from the beginning as defined in the previous section. 

If the *lead_time* parameter is less than the expiration time of the Access Token, the Wallet Instance MAY use it along with the *c_nonce* provided in the Credential Response to perform a new Credential Request without requiring the User to submit a new authentication request.

In the case where the Authentic Source and the PID/(Q)EAA Provider are both enabled to use *PDND*, what is described in Section :ref:`Authentic Sources` MUST apply.

Pushed Authorization Request Endpoint
-------------------------------------

Pushed Authorization Request (PAR) Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The request to the PID/(Q)EAA authorization endpoint MUST use HTTP Headers parameters and HTTP POST parameters.

The HTTP POST method MUST use the parameters in the message body encoded in ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` format. 

.. _table_http_request_claim:

In this mode, Authorization Response parameters are encoded in the query string added to the ``redirect_uri`` when redirecting back to the Wallet Instance. In case of *HTTP POST Response* the value MUST be *form_post.jwt* according to [`OAUTH-V2-JARM-04`_]. In this mode, Authorization Response parameters are specified into a JWT encoded as HTML form value that is auto-submitted in the user-agent, and thus is transmitted via the HTTP POST method to the Wallet Instance, with the result parameters being encoded in the body using the *application/x-www-form-urlencoded* format. The action attribute of the form MUST be the Redirection URI of the Wallet Instance. The method of the form attribute MUST be POST.

If any errors occur during the PAR Request, the Authorization Server MUST return an error response as defined in :rfc:`9126#section-2.3`. The response MUST use *application/json* as the content type and MUST include the following parameters:

  - *error*. The error code.
  - *error_description*. Text in human-readable form providing further details to clarify the nature of the error encountered.

Below is a non-normative example of an error response.

.. code:: http

  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
  Content-Type: application/json

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/par-error.json
  :language: JSON  



Authorization endpoint
----------------------

The authorization endpoint is used to interact with the PID/(Q)EAA Issuer and obtain an authorization grant.
The authorization server MUST first verify the identity of the User that own the credential.


Authorization Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Authorization request is issued by the Web Browser in use by the Wallet Instance, the HTTP methods **POST** or **GET** are used. When the method **POST** is used, the parameters MUST be sent using the *Form Serialization*. When the method **GET** is used, the parameters MUST be sent using the *Query String Serialization*. For more details see Section 13 of [`OIDC`_]. 

The mandatory parameters in the HTTP authentication request are specified in the following table.

.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 60 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **Claim**
      - **Description**
      - **Reference**
    * - **client_id**
      - It MUST be set as in the :ref:`Table of the HTTP parameters <table_http_request_claim>`.
      - See :ref:`Table of the HTTP parameters <table_http_request_claim>`.
    * - **request_uri**
      - It MUST be set to the same value as obtained by PAR Response. See :ref:`Table of the HTTP PAR Response parameters <table_http_response_claim>`.
      - [:rfc:`9126`].


.. note::

  In the case of PID issuance, the Wallet Instance MAY include the **idphinting** parameter as a URL encoded string. This parameter specifies the Identity Provider where the User wishes to authenticate.. See `AARC-G061 - A specification for IdP hinting. <https://aarc-community.org/guidelines/aarc-g061/>`_ for more details. 

Authorization Response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The authentication response is returned by the PID/(Q)EAA authorization endpoint at the end of the authentication flow.

If the authentication is successful the PID/(Q)EAA Issuer redirects the User by adding the following query parameters as required to the *redirect_uri*. The redirect URI MUST be an universal or app link registered with the local operating system, so this latter is able to provide the response to the Wallet Instance.

.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 60 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **Claim**
      - **Description**
      - **Reference**
    * - **code**
      - Unique *Authorization Code* that the Wallet Instance submits to the Token Endpoint.
      - [:rfc:`6749#section-4.1.2`], [:rfc:`7521`].
    * - **state**
      - The Wallet Instance MUST check the correspondence with the ``state`` parameter value in the Request Object. It is defined as in the :ref:`Table of the JWT Request parameters <table_jwt_request>`.
      - [:rfc:`6749#section-4.1.2`].
    * - **iss**
      - Unique identifier of the PID/(Q)EAA Issuer who created the Authentication Response. The Wallet Instance MUST validate this parameter.
      - [:rfc:`9207`], [:rfc:`7519`, Section 4.1.1.].

If any errors occur during the Authorization Request, the Authorization Server MUST return an error response as defined in :rfc:`6749#section-4.1.2.1`. The response MUST use *application/json* as the content type and MUST include the following parameters:

  - *error*. The error code.
  - *error_description*. Text in human-readable form providing further details to clarify the nature of the error encountered.

Token endpoint
--------------

The token endpoint is used by the Wallet Instance to obtain an Access Token by presenting an authorization grant, as
defined in :rfc:`6749`. The Token Endpoint is a protected endpoint with a client authentication based on the model defined in OAuth 2.0 Attestation-based Client Authentication [`OAUTH-ATTESTATION-CLIENT-AUTH`_ ].

.. _sec_token_request:

Token Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The request to the PID/(Q)EAA Token endpoint MUST be an HTTP request with method POST, with the body message encoded in ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` format. The Wallet Instance sends the Token endpoint request with ``OAuth-Client-Attestation`` and ``OAuth-Client-Attestation-PoP`` as header parameters according to `OAUTH-ATTESTATION-CLIENT-AUTH`_.

The Token endpoint is protected with OAuth 2.0 Attestation-based Client Authentication [`OAUTH-ATTESTATION-CLIENT-AUTH`_], therefore
the request to the PID/(Q)EAA authorization endpoint MUST use the following HTTP Headers parameters **OAuth-Client-Attestation** as **OAuth-Client-Attestation-PoP**
as defined in the "Pushed Authorization Request (PAR) Endpoint".

The Token endpoint issues DPoP tokens, therefore it is REQUIRED that the request incluides in its HTTP header the DPoP proof parameter.
The Token endpoint MUST validate the DPoP proof according to Section 4.3 of the DPoP specifications (:rfc:`9449`). This mitigates the misuse of leaked or stolen Access Tokens at the credential endpoint. If the DPoP proof is invalid, the Token endpoint returns an error response, according to Section 5.2 of [:rfc:`6749`] with ``invalid_dpop_proof`` as the value of the error parameter.

All the parameters listed below are REQUIRED:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 60 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **Claim**
      - **Description**
      - **Reference**
    * - **grant_type**
      - It MUST be set to ``authorization_code``.
      - [:rfc:`7521`].
    * - **code**

      - [:rfc:`7521`].
    * - **redirect_uri**
      - It MUST be set as in the Request Object :ref:`Table of the JWT Request parameters <table_jwt_request>`.
      - [:rfc:`7521`].
    * - **code_verifier**
      - Verification code of the **code_challenge**.
      - `Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636>`_.


A **DPoP Proof JWT** is included in the HTTP request using the ``DPoP`` header parameter containing a DPoP JWS.

The JOSE header of a **DPoP JWT** MUST contain at least the following parameters:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 60 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **JOSE header**
      - **Description**
      - **Reference**
    * - **typ**
      - It MUST be equal to ``dpop+jwt``.
      - [:rfc:`7515`] and [:rfc:`8725`. Section 3.11].
    * - **alg**
      - A digital signature algorithm identifier such as per IANA "JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms" registry. It MUST be one of the supported algorithms in Section :ref:`Cryptographic Algorithms <supported_algs>` and MUST NOT be set to ``none`` or with a symmetric algorithm (MAC) identifier.

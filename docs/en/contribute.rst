How to contribute
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The IT-Wallet project, including this document, follows an **open development process**. This approach ensures the development process is accessible to all, inviting all interested parties to participate.

Consequently, stakeholders, national and international community members are not only encouraged but also heartily welcomed to contribute to the refinement of these technical rules.

Below are several methods available for contributing to this project:

- **GitHub issues**. By opening an issue, you can seek clarification, propose enhancements, or report editorial typos. If you are working on an issue, we encourage you to open a draft pull request and link it.
- **Pull requests**. Pull requests represent active contributions to the project, typically, but not always following issue-based discussions. Once a pull request is initiated, it facilitates discussion and review of the proposed changes before they are merged into the main branch (`versione-corrente`).
- **Developers Italia Slack channel**. Slack is a messaging application designed for businesses, connecting people to the information they need. *Developers Italia* is an open community based on contributions and participation from public administrations, developers, technicians, students, and citizens. *Developers Italia* has initiated a Slack channel that [everyone can join for free](https://slack.developers.italia.it/), where you can learn about all their activities and partake in discussions.

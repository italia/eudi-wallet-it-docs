PID/(Q)EAA Issuance
+++++++++++++++++++

This section describes the PID and (Q)EAAs issuance flow with an high level of security. 
The relevant entities and interfaces involved in the issuance flow are:

    - *Wallet Provider*: The entity responsible for releasing an EUDI Wallet Solution. It also issues Wallet Instance Attestations to its Wallet Instances through an Attestation Service. The Wallet Attestation certifies the genuinity and authenticity of the Wallet Instance and its compliance with a Trust Framework in compliance to the security and privacy requirements.
    - *Wallet Solution*: Entire product and service owned by a Wallet Provider, offered to all the Users of that solution. The Wallet Solution is certified as EUDI-compliant by a Conformity Assessment Body (CAB).
    - *Wallet Instance*: Instance of a Wallet Solution, installed on the User device. It provides interfaces for User interaction with the Wallet Provider, Relying Parties, PID, and (Q)EAA Providers.
    - *PID Provider*: The entity that issues the eIDAS Person Identification Data (PID). It is composed of:

        - OpenID4VCI Component: based on the “OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance” specification  `[OIDC4VCI. Draft 13] <https://openid.bitbucket.io/connect/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html>`_ to release PID credentials.
        - National eID Relying Party (OpenID Connect or SAML2): It represents the component to authenticate the User with the national Digital Identity Providers.
        - National Identity Provider: It represents preexisting identity systems based on SAML2 or OpenID Connect, already in production in each Member State (for Italy SPID and CIE id authentication schemed notified eIDAS with *LoA* **High**, see `SPID/CIE OpenID Connect Specifications <https://italia.github.io/spid-cie-oidc-docs/en/>`_).
    
    - *(Q)EAA Provider*: It represents the Issuer of (Q)EAAs. It is composed of:

      - OpenID4VCI Component: based on the “OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance” specification  `[OIDC4VCI. Draft 13] <https://openid.bitbucket.io/connect/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html>`_ to release (Q)EAAs.
      - Relying Party: It represents the component to authenticate the User with the PID. The (Q)EAA Provider acts as a Verifier and it sends a presentation request to the Wallet Instance according to [`OpenID4VP`_]. The Wallet Instance MUST have a valid PID obtained prior to starting a transaction with the (Q)EAA Provider.
    

High-Level PID flow

    PID Issuance - General architecture and high level flow

Below a detailed description for each step represented in the previous picture:

    0. **Wallet Instance Setup**: the first time the Wallet Instance is started a preliminary setup phase MUST be carried out. It consists of the release of a verifiable proof issued by the Attestation Service provided by the Wallet Provider that asserts the genuineness, the authenticity and the compliance with a trust framework of the Wallet Instance. The verifiable proof binds a public key corresponding to a local private key generated by the Wallet Instance. 
    1. **Obtaining the Trusted PID Provider**: the Wallet Instance discovers the trusted PID Provider at the Subordinate Listing Endpoint of the Trust Anchor, and then inspects the Metadata looking for the availability of the PID credential. 
    2. **Obtaining of PID Provider Metadata**: the Wallet Instance establishes the trust to the PID Provider according to the Trust Model, obtaining the Metadata that discloses the formats of the PID, the algorithms supported, and any other parameter required for interoperability needs.
    3. **PID Request**: following the Authorization Code Flow in `[OIDC4VCI. Draft 13] <https://openid.bitbucket.io/connect/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html>`_ the Wallet Instance requests a PID to the PID Provider. A fresh key pair that is generated by the Wallet Instance for the purpose of the sender-constrained Access Token will be used by the PID Provider for the key binding of the PID.
    4. **User Authentication**: the PID Provider authenticates the User with LoA High, acting as an IAM Proxy to the National eID system. 
    5. **PID Issuance**: once the User authentication with LoA High happens, the User gives their consent, and the PID Provider releases a PID bound to the key material held by the requesting Wallet Instance.

The Wallet Instance Setup phase is described in Section [...]. In the following Section the steps from 1 to 5 are further expanded into more technical detailed steps. 

High-Level (Q)EAA flow
----------------------

The :numref:`fig_High-Level-Flow-ITWallet-QEAA-Issuance` shows a general architecture and highlights the main operations involved in the issuance of a (Q)EAA, following the assumptions listed below:

  - the User has a valid PID stored in their own Wallet Instance;
  - the (Q)EAA requires a high security implementation profile.

    (Q)EAA Issuance - General architecture and high level flow

Below the description of the most relevant operations involved in the (Q)EAA issuance:

    1. **Obtaining the Trusted (Q)EAA Provider**: the Wallet Instance discovers the trusted (Q)EAA Provider at the Subordinate Listing Endpoint of the Trust Anchor, and then inspects the Metadata looking for the credential capabilities. 
    2. **Obtaining of (Q)EAA Provider Metadata**: the Wallet Instance establishes the trust to the (Q)EAA Provider according to the Trust Model, obtaining the Metadata that discloses the formats of the (Q)EAA, the algorithms supported, and any other parameter required for interoperability needs.
    3. **(Q)EAA Request**: following the Authorization Code Flow in `[OIDC4VCI. Draft 13] <https://openid.bitbucket.io/connect/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html>`_ the Wallet Instance requests a (Q)EAA to the (Q)EAA Provider. A fresh key pair that is generated by the Wallet Instance for the purpose of the sender-constrained Access Token will be used by (Q)EAA Provider for the key binding of the (Q)EAA. The (Q)EAA Provider checks the Wallet Instance by means of the Wallet Instance Attestation and the Trust Chain related to the Wallet Provider.
    4. **User Authentication**: the (Q)EAA Provider, acting as a Verifier (Relying Party), authenticates the User with the PID. 
    5. **(Q)EAA Issuance**: Once the User has been authenticated with a valid PID, the User gives their consent, then the (Q)EAA Provider releases a (Q)EAA bound to the key material held by the requesting Wallet Instance.



Detailed Flow
-------------

The PID/(Q)EAA Issuance phase is based on the **Authorization Code Flow** with **Pushed Authorization Requests** (PAR) [:rfc:`9126`] and **PKCE** (Proof Key for Code Exchange, :rfc:`7636`) as recommended in `[OIDC4VCI. Draft 13. Section 3.4] <https://openid.bitbucket.io/connect/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html#section-3.4>`_. A *Wallet Initiated Flow* is considered and the User receives the PID/(Q)EAA directly in response to the Credential Request (*Immediate Flow*).

  All the non-normative examples are referred to the PID Provider issuance flow.

    PID/(Q)EAA Issuance - Detailed flow


**Steps 1-4 (Discovery):** The User selects the PID/(Q)EAA Provider, and the Wallet Instance obtains the Metadata for the selected PID/(Q)EAA Provider.

.. note::

    **Federation Check:** The Wallet Instance needs to check if the PID/(Q)EAA Provider is part of the Federation, obtaining then its protocol specific Metadata. A non-normative example of a response from the endpoint **.well-known/openid-federation** with the **Entity Configuration** and the **Metadata** of the PID/(Q)EAA Provider is represented within the section `Entity Configuration Credential Issuer`_.


**Steps 5-6 (PAR Request):** The Wallet Instance creates a fresh PKCE code verifier, and ``state`` parameter for the *Pushed Authorization Request*. The Wallet Instance sends these parameters along in a *Pushed Authorization Request* using the OIDC ``request`` parameter (hereafter Request Object) (see :rfc:`9126` Section 3) to the PID/(Q)EAA Provider PAR endpoint to prevent Request URI swapping attack (see :rfc:`9126`). The Wallet Instance MUST create the ``code_verifier`` with enough entropy random string using the unreserved characters with a minimum length of 43 characters and a maximum length of 128 characters to make it impractical for an attacker to guess its value. The value MUST be generated following the recommendation in Section 4.1 of (see :rfc:`7636`). The Wallet Instance signs this request using the private key that is created during the setup phase to obtain the Wallet Instance Attestation. The related public key that is attested by the Wallet Provider is inside the Wallet Instance Attestation ``cnf`` claim.. An OAuth2 client authentication method is involved, since in this flow the Pushed Authorization Endpoint is a protected endpoint. The client authentication is based on the model defined in [:rfc:`7521`] using the Wallet Instance Attestation JWS inside the ``client_assertion`` parameter. The authorization_details [RAR :rfc:`9396`] parameter is extended to allow Wallet Instance to specify the types of the credentials when requesting authorization for the PID/(Q)EAA issuance. The PID/(Q)EAA Provider performs the following checks upon the receipt of the PAR request:
  
    1. It MUST validate the signature of the Request Object using the algorithm specified in the ``alg`` header parameter (:rfc:`9126`, :rfc:`9101`) and the public key that can be retrieved from the Wallet Instance Attestation (``cnf``) identified using the ``kid`` header of the Request Object.
    2. It MUST check that the used algorithm for signing the request in the ``alg`` header is among the appropriate once reported in Section `Cryptographic Algorithms <algorithms.html>`_.
    3. It MUST check that the ``client_id`` in the request body of the PAR request matches the ``client_id`` claim in the Request Object. 
    4. It MUST check that the ``iss`` claim in the Request Object matches the ``client_id`` claim in the Request Object (:rfc:`9126`, :rfc:`9101`).
    5. It MUST check that the ``aud`` claim in the Request Object is equal to the identifier of PID/(Q)EAA Provider (:rfc:`9126`, :rfc:`9101`).
    6. It MUST reject the PAR request, if it contains the ``request_uri`` parameter (:rfc:`9126`).
    7. It MUST check that the Request Object contains all the mandatory parameters and their values are validated according to what we defined in :ref:`Table of the HTTP parameters <table_http_request_claim>` [derived from :rfc:`9126`].
    8. It MUST check that the Request Object is not expired by checking the ``exp`` claim (:rfc:`9126`).
    9. It MUST check that the Request Object was issued at a time acceptable by the PID/(Q)EAA Provider by checking the ``iat`` claim. For example, basing on the security policies of the PID/(Q)EAA Provider, it might reject the request if the ``iat`` claim is too far away from the current time (:rfc:`9126`).
    10. It MUST check that the ``jti`` claim in the Request Object has not been used before by the Wallet Instance identified by the ``client_id``. This allows the PID/(Q)EAA Provider to mitigate replay attacks (:rfc:`7519`).

    "redirect_uri":"eudiw://start.wallet.example.org",
    "client_assertion_type":"urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-client-attestation", 
    }


.. note::

    **Federation Check:** The PID/(Q)EAA Provider MUST check that the Wallet Provider is part of the federation and in addition it MUST verify the Wallet Instance Attestation validity by checking its signature and data. 


**Step 7 (PAR Response):**  The PID/(Q)EAA Provider MUST issue the ``request_uri`` one-time use and bind it to the client identifier (``client_id``) that is provided in the Request Object. Furthermore, the entropy of the ``request_uri`` MUST be sufficiently large. The adequate shortness of the validity and the entropy of the ``request_uri`` depends on the risk calculation based on the value of the resource being protected. The validity time SHOULD be less than a minute, and the ``request_uri`` MUST include a cryptographic random value of 128 bits or more (:rfc:`9101`). The entire ``request_uri`` SHOULD NOT exceed 512 ASCII characters due to the following two main reasons (:rfc:`9101`):

    1. Many phones on the market still do not accept large payloads. The restriction is typically either 512 or 1024 ASCII characters.
    2. On a slow connection such as a 2G mobile connection, a large URL would cause a slow response; therefore, the use of such is not advisable from the user-experience point of view. 
 
 The PID/(Q)EAA Provider returns the issued ``request_uri`` to the Wallet Instance. 

.. code-block:: http

    HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {
        "request_uri":"urn:ietf:params:oauth:request_uri:bwc4JK-ESC0w8acc191e-Y1LTC2",
        "expires_in": 60
    }
    


**Steps 8-9 (Authorization Request):** The Wallet Instance sends an authorization request to the PID/(Q)EAA Provider Authorization Endpoint. Since parts of this Authorization Request content, e.g., the ``code_challenge`` parameter value, are unique to a particular Authorization Request, the Wallet Instance MUST only use a ``request_uri`` value once (:rfc:`9126`); The  PID/(Q)EAA Provider performs the following checks upon the receipt of the Authorization Request:

    1. It MUST treat ``request_uri`` values as one-time use and MUST reject an expired request. However, it MAY allow for duplicate requests due to a user reloading/refreshing their user agent (derived from :rfc:`9126`).
    2. It MUST identify the request as a result of the submitted PAR (derived from :rfc:`9126`).
    3. It MUST reject all the Authorization Requests that do not contain the ``request_uri`` parameter as the PAR is the only way to pass the Authorization Request from the Wallet Instance (derived from :rfc:`9126`).  


.. code-block:: http

    GET /authorize?client_id=$thumprint-of-the-jwk-in-the-cnf-wallet-attestation$&request_uri=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Arequest_uri%3Abwc4JK-ESC0w8acc191e-Y1LTC2 HTTP/1.1
    Host: pid-provider.example.org
 

.. note::

   **User Authentication and Consent:** The PID Provider performs the User authentication based on the requirements of eIDAS LoA High by means of national notified eIDAS scheme and requires the User consent for the PID issuance. 
   The (Q)EAA Provider performs the User authentication requesting a valid PID to the Wallet Instance. The (Q)EAA Provider MUST use [`OpenID4VP`_] to dynamically request the presentation of the PID. From a protocol perspective, the (Q)EAA Provider then acts as a Verifier and sends a presentation request to the Wallet Instance. The Wallet Instance MUST have a valid PID obtained prior to starting a transaction with the (Q)EAA Provider.

**Steps 10-11 (Authorization Response):** The PID/(Q)EAA Provider sends an authorization ``code`` together with ``state`` and ``iss`` parameters to the Wallet Instance. The Wallet Instance performs the following checks on the Authorization Response:

    1. It MUST check the Authorization Response contains all the defined parameters according to what we defined in :ref:`Table of the HTTP Response parameters <table_http_response_claim>`.
    2. It MUST check the returned value by the PID/(Q)EAA Provider for ``state`` parameter is equal to the value sent by Wallet Instance in the Request Object (:rfc:`6749`).
    3. It MUST check that the URL of PID/(Q)EAA Provider in ``iss`` parameter is equal to the URL identifier of intended PID/(Q)EAA Provider that the Wallet Instance start the communication with (:rfc:`9027`).

.. note::

    The Wallet Instance redirect URI is a universal or app link registered with the local operating system, so this latter will resolve it and pass the response to the Wallet Instance.
 
.. code-block:: http

    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    Location: eudiw://start.wallet.example.org?code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA&state=fyZiOL9Lf2CeKuNT2JzxiLRDink0uPcd&iss=https%3A%2F%2Fpid-provider.example.org

**Steps 12-13 (DPoP Proof for Token Endpoint)**: The Wallet Instance MUST create a new key pair for the DPoP and a fresh DPoP Proof JWT following the instruction provided in Section 4 of (:rfc:`9449`) for the token request to the PID/(Q)EAA Provider. The DPoP Proof JWT is signed using the created private key for DPoP by Wallet Instance. DPoP provides a way to bind the Access Token to a certain sender (Wallet Instance) (:rfc:`9449`). This mitigates the misuse of leaked or stolen Access Tokens at the Credential Endpoint of PID/(Q)EAA Issuer as the attacker needs to present a valid DPoP Proof JWT.

**Step 14 (Token Request):** The Wallet Instance sends a token request to the PID/(Q)EAA Provider Token Endpoint using the authorization ``code``, ``code_verifier``, *DPoP Proof JWT* and ``private_key_jwt`` parameters (``client_assertion_type`` and ``client_assertion``). 
The ``client_assertion`` is signed using the private key that is created during the setup phase to obtain the Wallet Instance Attestation. The related public key that is attested by the Wallet Provider is inside the Wallet Instance Attestation (``cnf`` claim). The PID/(Q)EAA Provider performs the following checks on the Token Request:

   1. It MUST authenticate the Wallet Instance based on the ``private_key_jwt`` Client Authentication method `OpenID.Core#TokenRequest <https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#TokenRequest>`_.
   2. It MUST ensure that the Authorization ``code`` is issued to the authenticated Wallet Instance (:rfc:`6749`).
   3. It MUST ensure the Authorization ``code`` is valid and has not been previously used (:rfc:`6749`).
   4. It MUST ensure the ``redirect_uri`` is identical to the value that was initially included in the Request Object `OpenID.Core#TokenRequest <https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#TokenRequest>`_.
   5. It MUST validate the DPoP Proof JWT following the steps in Section 4.3 of (:rfc:`9449`).

    &client_assertion=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiI


**Step 15 (Token Response):** The PID/(Q)EAA Provider validates the request and if it is successful, it issues an *Access Token* (bound to the DPoP key) and a fresh ``c_nonce``.  

.. code-block:: http

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    Cache-Control: no-store

    "expires_in": 2677,
    "c_nonce": "tZign[...]snFbp",
    "c_nonce_expires_in": 86400
    }


**Steps 16-17 (DPoP Proof for Credential Endpoint):** The Wallet Instance creates a proof of possession with the DPoP key following the steps in Section 7.2.1 of `OPENID4VCI`_ and the ``c_nonce`` obtained in **Step 15** and it creates a DPoP Proof JWT based on Section 4 of (:rfc:`9449`) for the request to the PID/(Q)EAA credential issuance endpoint. The ``jwk`` value in the proof parameter MUST be equal to the same public key that is generated for the DPoP.     

**Step 18 (Credential Request):** The Wallet Instance sends a PID/(Q)EAA issuance request to the PID/(Q)EAA credential endpoint. It contains the *Access Token*, the *DPoP Proof JWT*, the *credential type*, the ``proof`` (proof of possession of the key) and the ``format``.

.. note::

    **PID Credential Schema and Status registration:** The PID/(Q)EAA Provider MUST register all the issued credentials for their later revocation, if needed.

**Steps 19-21 (Credential Response):** The PID/(Q)EAA Provider MUST validate the *DPoP JWT Proof* based on the steps defined in Section 4.3 of (:rfc:`9449`) and whether the *Access Token* is valid and suitable for the requested PID/(Q)EAA. It also MUST validate the proof of possession for the key material the new credential SHALL be bound to following the steps in Section 7.2.2 of `OPENID4VCI`_. If all checks succeed, the PID/(Q)EAA Provider creates a new credential bound to the key material and sends it to the Wallet Instance. The Wallet Instance MUST perform the following checks before proceeding with the secure storage of the PID/(Q)EAA credential: 

    1. It MUST check that the PID Credential Response contains all the mandatory parameters and values are validated according to what we defined in :ref:`Table of the credential response parameters <table_credential_response_claim>`.
    2. It MUST check the PID integrity by verifying the signature using the algorithm specified in the ``alg`` header parameter of SD-JWT (:ref:`PID/(Q)EAA Data Model <pid_eaa_data_model.rst>`) and the public key that is identified using using the ``kid`` header of the SD-JWT.
    3. It MUST check that the received PID credential (in credential claim) contains all the mandatory parameters that we defined in :ref:`PID/(Q)EAA Data Model <pid_eaa_data_model.rst>`.
    4. It MUST process and verify the PID that is in SD-JWT VC following the steps in Section 6 of `SD.JWT#Verification <https://drafts.oauth.net/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt.html#name-verification-and-processing>`_.
    5. It MUST verify the Trust Chain in the header of SD-JWT VC to verify if the issuer of the PID is trusted.

If the checks are successful it can proceed with secure storage of the PID credential.

    * - **expires_in**
      - A JSON number that represents the lifetime of the request URI in seconds as a positive integer.
      - [:rfc:`9126`].


Authorization endpoint
----------------------

The authorization endpoint is used to interact with the PID/(Q)EAA Issuer and obtain an authorization grant.
The authorization server MUST first verify the identity of the resource owner (the User that own it's credentials) 
as defined in the :rfc:`6749`.

Authorization Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Authorization request is issued by the Wallet Instance Browser, HTTP **POST** or **GET** methods MAY be used. When the method **POST** is used, the parameters MUST be sent using the *Form Serialization*. When the method **GET** is used, the parameters MUST be sent using the *Query String Serialization*. For more details see `OpenID.Core#Serializations <https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Serializations>`_.

The mandatory parameters in the HTTP authentication request are specified in the following table.

.. list-table:: 
    :widths: 20 60 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **Claim**
      - **Description**

      - It MUST be set to the same value as obtained by PAR Response. See :ref:`Table of the HTTP PAR Response parameters <table_http_response_claim>`.
      - [:rfc:`9126`].


Authorization Response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The authentication response is returned by the PID/(Q)EAA authorization endpoint at the end of the authentication flow.

If the authentication is successful the PID/(Q)EAA Issuer redirects the User by adding the following query parameters as required to the *redirect_uri*. The redirect URI MUST be an universal or app link registered with the local operating system, so this latter is able to resolve its value and delegates the Wallet Instance for the processing.

.. list-table:: 
    :widths: 20 60 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **Claim**
      - **Description**

Token endpoint
--------------

The token endpoint is used by the Wallet Instance 
to obtain an Access Token by presenting its authorization grant, as 
defined in :rfc:`6749`.

Token Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The request to the PID/(Q)EAA Token endpoint MUST be an HTTP request with method POST, where its body message is encoded in ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` format. The Wallet Instance sends the Token endpoint request with *private_key_jwt* authentication and a *DPoP proof* containing the mandatory parameters, defined in the table below.

The Token endpoint MUST accept and validate the DPoP proof sent in the DPoP HTTP header. The Token endpoint MUST validate the DPoP proof according to Section 4.3 of the DPoP specifications (:rfc:`9449`). Thus, this mitigates the misuse of leaked or stolen Access Tokens at the credential endpoint. If the DPoP proof is invalid, the Token endpoint returns an error response, according to Section 5.2 of [:rfc:`6749`] with ``invalid_dpop_proof`` as the value of the error parameter.

The Wallet Instance when requests the PID/(Q)EAA to the PID/(Q)EAA Credential endpoint, MUST use the following parameters in the entity-body of the HTTP POST request, using the `application/json` media type.
The Credential endpoint MUST accept and validate the *DPoP proof* sent in the DPoP field of the Header based on the steps defined in Section 4.3 of (:rfc:`9449`). The *DPoP proof* in addition to the values that are defined in the Token Endpoint section MUST contain the following claim:

  - **ath**: hash of the Access Token. The value MUST be the result of a base64url encoding (as defined in Section 2 of :rfc:`7515`) the SHA-256 hash of the ASCII encoding of the associated Access Token's value.

If the *DPoP proof* is invalid, the Credential endpoint returns an error response per Section 5.2 of [:rfc:`6749`] with `invalid_dpop_proof` as the value of the error parameter.  

.. warning::
  The Wallet Instance MUST create a **new DPoP proof** for the Credential request and MUST NOT use the previously created proof for the Token Endpoint.

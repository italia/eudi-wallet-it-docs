Wallet Solution
-------------------

The Wallet Solution is a comprehensive product offered by the Wallet Provider to cater to the needs of Users in managing their digital assets securely. It is issued by the Wallet Provider in the form of a mobile app, it also consists of services and web interfaces for the exchange of data between the Wallet Provider and its Wallet Instances for the requirements of the trust model and in total respect of the User's privacy, in accordance with national and EU legislation.

The mobile app serves as the primary interface for Users, allowing them to access and interact with their digital Credentials conveniently. These are a set of data that can uniquely identify a natural or a legal person, along with other Qualified and non-qualified Electronic Attestations of Attributes, also known as QEAAs and EAAs respectively, or (Q)EAAs for short[1]. Once a User installs the mobile app on their device, it is referred to such an installation as a Wallet Instance for the User.

By supporting the mobile app, the Wallet Provider plays a vital role in ensuring the security and reliability of the entire Wallet Solution, since it is responsible for issuing the Wallet Attestation, that is a cryptographic proof that allow the evaluation of the authenticity and the integrity of the Wallet Instance.

The Wallet Provider MUST offer a RESTful set of services for issuing the Wallet Attestations.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section lists below the essential requirements that must be met by the Wallet Solution to ensure its functionality, security, and compliance with relevant standards and regulations.

 - **Trustworthiness within the Wallet ecosystem**: the Wallet Instance MUST establish trust and reliability within the Wallet ecosystem.
 - **Compliance with Provider specifications for obtaining PID and (Q)EAA**: the Wallet Instance MUST adhere to the specifications set by Providers for obtaining Personal Identification (PID) and (Q)EAAs.
 - **Support for Android and iOS operating systems**: the Wallet Instance MUST be compatible and functional at least on both Android and iOS operating systems, as well as available on the Play Store and App Store respectively.
 - **Verification of device ownership by the User**: the Wallet Instance MUST provide a mechanism to verify the User's actual possession and full control of their personal device.


Wallet Instance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Wallet Instance serves as a unique and secure device for authenticating the User within the Wallet ecosystem. It establishes a strong and reliable mechanismm for the User to engage various digital transactions in a secure and privacy-preserving manner.

The Wallet Instance establishes the trust within the Wallet ecosystem by consistently presenting a Wallet Attestation during interactions with other ecosystem actors such as PID Providers, (Q)EAA Providers, and Relying Parties. These verifiable attestations, provided by the Wallet Provider, purpose to authenticate the Wallet Instance itself, ensuring its realiability when engaging with other ecosystem actors.

To guarantee the utmost security, these cryptographic keys MUST be securely stored within the WSCD which MAY be internal (device's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)[3]), external, or hybrid. This ensures that only the User is allowed to access them, thus preventing unauthorized usage or tampering. For more detailed information please refer to the `Wallet Attestation section`_ and the `Trust Model section`_ of this document.

Wallet Instance Lifecycle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Wallet Instance has three distinct states: Operational, Valid, and Deactivated. Each state represents a specific functional status and determines the actions that can be performed[2].

Initialization Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To activate the Wallet Instance, the Users MUST install the mobile Wallet application on their device and open it. Furthermore, Users will be asked to set their preferred method of unlocking their device; this can be accomplished by entering a personal identification number (PIN) or by utilizing biometric authentication, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, according to their personal preferences and device's capabilities.

After completing these steps, the Wallet Instance sets the Operational state.

Transition to Valid state
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To transition from the Operational state to the Valid state, the Wallet Instance MUST obtain a valid Personal Identification (PID). Once a valid PID is acquired, the Wallet Instance becomes Valid.

To securely and unambiguously authenticate Users, the Wallet Instance necessitates a High Level of Assurance (LoA 3) for User authentication. The method to achieve this LoA is selected by the PID Provider based on the identity proofing method employed during the provisioning of the Digital Credential to the User. Furthermore, to store the acquired Digital Credential, the Wallet Instance MUST demonstrate to the Credential Issuer an adequate security compliance to maintain the Credential at the same LoA at which it was issued.

Once the Wallet Instance is in the Operational state, Users can:

 - Obtain, view, and manage (Q)EAAs from trusted (Q)EAA Providers[1];
 - Authenticate to Relying Parties[1];
 - Authorize the presentation of their digital Credentials with Relying Parties.

Please refer to the relative sections for further information about PID and (Q)EAAs issuance and presentation.


Return to Operational state
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A Valid Wallet Instance may revert to the Operational state under specific circumstances. These circumstances include the expiration or the revocation of the associated PID by its PID Provider.


Deactivation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Users have the ability to deactivate the Wallet Instance voluntarily. This action removes the operational capabilities of the Wallet Instance and sets it to the Deactivated state. Deactivation provides Users with control over access and usage according to their preferences.


Wallet Provider Endpoints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Wallet Provider that issues the Wallet Attestations MUST
made available its APIs in the form of RESTful services, as listed below.

Wallet Provider Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An HTTP GET request to the **/.well-known/openid-federation** endpoint allows the retrieval of the Wallet
Provider Entity Configuration.

The Wallet Provider Entity Configuration is a JWS containing the public keys and supported algorithms of the Wallet Provider metadata definition. It is structured in accordance with the `OpenID Connect Federation <https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-federation-1_0.html>`_ and the Trust Model section outlined in this specification.

The returning Entity Configuration of the Wallet Provider MUST contain the
attributes listed below:

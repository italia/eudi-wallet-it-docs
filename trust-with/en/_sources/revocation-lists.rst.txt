Credential Lifecycle
++++++++++++++++++++

The value of a Digital Credential is conditional on its validity. A Credential that has been revoked, due to legal requirements, inaccuracy or compromise, is valueless and potentially harmful. 
For these reasons a robust mechanism for managing the life-cycle and the revocation of a Digital Credential is required.

This section outlines the key technical requirements and processes related to the revocation of Digital Credentials. 
Furthermore, it provides the technical details that the Verifiers MUST implement to verify, in a secure and reliable manner, the validity of a Digital Credential during the presentation phase.

The verification of the validity of a Digital Credential is based on the `OAUTH-STATUS-ASSERTION`_.

A Status Assertion is a signed document serving as proof of a Digital Credential's current validity status. The Credential Issuer provides these assertions to Holders who can present them to Verifiers together with the corresponding Digital Credentials. 

The Status Assertions have the following features:

- automated issuance, as the User authentication is not required for the provisioning of the Status Assertion; 
- verification of the Digital Credential validity status in both online and offline scenarios;
- privacy-preserving, according to the following evidences:

  1. the Verifier can check the validity of the Credential during the presentation phase. It is not able to check the validity of a given Digital Credential related to the User over time and out of the scope of the User authentication;
  2. the Credential Issuers is not able to know to which Verifier the Digital Credential or the Status Assertion will be presented;
  3. it doesn't reveal any information about the Users or the content of their Digital Credentials.

.. _sec_revocation_assumption:

Operational Requirements
------------------------

- **Internet Connection for Status Assertions**: Status Assertions can be obtained only when the Wallet Instance is connected to the internet and actively operated by the User. 
- **Role of a Credential Issuer**: A Credential Issuer is responsible for creating and issuing Credentials, as well as managing their lifecycle and validity status.
- **Involvement of Authentic Sources**: When one or more Authentic Sources are involved in the issuance of a Digital Credential, the information exchanged between the Authentic Source and the Credential Issuer is crucial for the Digital Credential's issuance. Furthermore, in cases where the Authentic Source initiates a revocation or data changes, revoking the Digital Credential becomes necessary.


.. _sec_revocation_requirements:

Functional Requirements
-----------------------

In addition to the requirements in Section 5 of `OAUTH-STATUS-ASSERTION`_, **The Status Assertion:**

- MUST have a validity period not greater than 24 hours;
- MUST NOT reveal any information about the Relying Party, the User's device or the User's data contained in the Digital Credential the assertion is related to;
- MUST be non-repudiable even beyond its expiration time and even in the case of cryptographic keys rotation.


**The Credential Issuer MUST:**

- ensure that the data contained in a Digital Credential is kept up to date, including the status of validity of the data from the Authentic Source;
- revoke a Digital Credential when the following circumstances occur:

  - the Digital Credential requires to be updated, whenever one or more attributes are changed; in this case the User will request a new issuance for that Digital Credential;
  - the Holder needs to address the loss or compromise of cryptographic key material associated with the issued Digital Credential. In such case, the End-User should request the revocation of the Digital Credential through a service provided by the Credential Issuer and using an authentication method that offers the same Level of Assurance obtained during the Credential Issuance;
  - the User deletes the Digital Credential from the Wallet Instance. The Wallet Instance therefore should request the revocation of such Digital Credential to the Credential Issuer;

- provide a web service for allowing a Wallet Instance, with a proof of possession of a specific Digital Credential, to 

  - request a revocation of that Digital Credential;
  - obtain a related Status Assertion;

- provide out-of-band mechanisms through which the User can request the revocation of their Digital Credentials, using a robust procedure for identity proofing and User authentication, in particular when the User is unable to use the personal Wallet Instance. 


**The Wallet Instance MUST:**

- check periodically the validity status of the Digital Credential that is stored in it, requesting a Status Assertion for each Digital Credential;
- be able to present a Status Assertion if required by a Verifier, along with the corresponding Digital Credential;
- request a revocation of a Digital Credential when the Users delete it from the storage. 


**The Authentic Sources MUST:**

- provide web services for the providing of updated User data and the validity status;
- store in local databases only the minimum information required to provide the Credential Issuer with the User data or a change in the validity status.


Revocation Use Cases
--------------------

The revocation of a Digital Credential MAY be triggered by: 

- Users using their personal Wallet Instance or by some out-of-band touchpoints.
- Revocation of the Wallet Instance.
- Authentic Sources (e.g., for attribute updates) following administrative purposes. 
- Law-Enforcing Bodies for the fulfillment of their functions and any other judicial reasons (e.g., Police).

Credential Revocation Flows can start under different scenarios, such as:

    - The User reports the loss or theft of their own physical document to the Law-Enforcement Authorities: this implies that the Credentials, if any, shall be revoked.
    - The User notifies an Authentic Source that one or more attributes are changed (e.g. the current resident address): in this case the Credentials MUST be revoked, as they are no longer valid due to the change in attributes. 
    - Users who lose access to their Wallet Instance (e.g., due to theft or loss of the device) can request the Credential Issuer to revoke their Credentials or ask the Wallet Provider to revoke the Wallet Instance. If the Wallet Provider is authorized by the User and is aware of the types of Credentials and their issuers stored in the Wallet, it can then initiate the revocation of all Digital Credentials contained within the Wallet Instance on behalf of the User.
    - The Law-Enforcing Authorities, for the fulfillment of their functions and any other judicial reasons, may request the Authentic Source to revoke entitlements, licenses, certificates, identification documents, etc., which in turn leads to the revocation of any linked Credentials.
    - The Authentic Sources that for any update of one or more User attributes, SHOULD inform the Credential Issuer that has previously requested those data for the issuance of a Credential about that User. 
    - The Credential Issuers, for technical security reasons (e.g. in the case of compromised cryptographic keys), SHOULD decide to revoke the Credentials.


The revocation scenarios involve two main flows:

    - The **Revocation flows**: these flows describe how an Entity requests for a Digital Credential revocation. 
    - The **Status Assertion flows**: these flows define the technical protocols for requesting and obtaining a Status Assertion and how the Wallet Instance SHOULD provide it to a Verifier as a proof of validity of a corresponding Digital Credential.


.. _sec_revocation_high_level_flow:

Revocation Flows
----------------

Depending on the different scenarios that may involve the revocation of a Digital Credential, different processes and technical flows may be implemented, according to national laws or Regulations of specific domains.
The subsequent sections define the protocol interface between the Wallet Instances and the Credential Issuers during the revocation request. The communication between the Credential Issuers and other Entities is out-of-scope of this technical implementation profile.


.. _sec_revocation_wi_initiated_flow:

Revocation Request by Wallet Instance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Wallet Instance MUST request the revocation of a Digital Credential as defined below.

    Wallet Instance Initiated Revocation Flow

**Step 1 (Credential Revocation Request)**: The Wallet Instance initiates the process by creating a Credential Revocation Request. This request MUST be sent to the Credential Issuer who has previously issued that Credential. The Credential Revocation Request MUST contain a JSON object with the member `revocation_requests`.

The `revocation_requests` MUST be set with an array of strings, where each string within the array represents a Credential Revocation Request object, enabling the Wallet Instance to request multiple Credential Revocation Requests to a single Credential Issuer.

The request MUST be signed with the private key related to the public key contained within the Credential (such as the Credential Issuer Signed JWT in the case of SD-JWT, or the MSO in the case of Mdoc CBOR). Then, the Wallet Instance sends the request to the Credential Issuer as in the following non-normative example representing a Revocation Assertion Request array.

.. _credential_revocation_request_ex:
.. code-block::
    
    POST /revoke HTTP/1.1
    Host: pid-provider.example.org
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    revocation_requests : ["${base64url(json({typ: revocation-assertion+jwt, ...}))}.payload.signature", ... ]
   
 
Below, is given a non-normative example of a single Revocation Assertion Request object with decoded JWT headers and payload and without signature for better readability:

.. _credential_pop_jwt_ex:
.. code-block::

    }
    .

      "credential_hash": $Issuer-Signed-JWT-Hash,
      "credential_hash_alg": "sha-256"
    }

**Step 2 (Revocation Assertion Request verification)**: The Credential Issuer verifies the proof of possession of the Credential requested to be revoked, using the the confirmation method that was attested in the Credential. If the verification is successful the revocation request is allowed.

**Step 3 (Credential Revocation)**: The Credential Issuer revokes the Credential provided in the Revocation Request object. After the revocation, the Credential Issuer MAY also send a notification to the User (e.g. using a User's email address, telephone number, or any other verified and secure communication channel), with all needed information related to the Credential revocation status update. This communication is out of scope of the current technical implementation profile. 

**Step 4 (Credential Revocation Response)**: The Credential Issuer sends a response back to the Wallet Instance with the result of the revocation request.

.. code::

    .. code-block:: http
		HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
		Content-Type: application/json

		{
			"revocation_assertion_responses": ["${base64url(json({typ: revocation_assertion+jwt, ...}))}.payload.signature", ... ]
		}

Status Assertion Flows
------------------------

The Status Assertion process is divided into the following phases:

  1. The Status Assertion Request by a Wallet Instance: it involves the Wallet Instance and the Credential Issuer.
  2. The Status Assertion Presentation to a Verifier: it involves the Wallet Instance and the Verifier.

    High-Level Status Assertion Flows


.. _sec_revocation_status_assertion_request:

Status Assertion Request by Wallet Instance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The presentation of a Credential to a Verifier may occur long after it has been issued by the Credential Issuer. During this time interval, the Credential can be invalidated for any reason and therefore the Verifier also needs to verify its revocation or suspension status. To address this scenario, the Credential Issuer provides the Wallet Instance with a *Status Assertion*. This Assertion is bound to a Credential so that the Wallet Instance can present it to a Verifier, along with the Credential itself, as proof of non-revocation status of the Credential.

The following diagram shows how the Wallet Instance requests a Status Assertion to the Credential Issuer.

.. _fig_Low-Level-Flow-Status-Assertion:
.. figure:: ../../images/Low-Level-Flow-Revocation-Attestation.svg
    :figwidth: 100%

    Status Assertion Request Flow

**Step 1 (Status Assertion Request)**: The Wallet Instance sends the Status Assertion Request to the Credential Issuer, where:

- The request MUST contain the base64url encoded hash value of the Digital Credential, for which the Status Assertion is requested, and enveloped in a signed Status Assertion Request object.

- The Status Assertion Request object MUST be signed with the private key corresponding to the confirmation claim assigned by the Issuer and contained within the Digital Credential.

Below a non-normative example representing a Status Assertion Request array with a single Status Assertion Request object in JWT format.

.. code::

    POST /status HTTP/1.1
    Host: issuer.example.org
    Content-Type: application/json

	{
		"status_assertion_requests" : ["${base64url(json({typ: status-assertion+jwt, ...}))}.payload.signature", ... ]
	}

The Status Assertion HTTP request can be sent to a single Credential Issuer regarding multiple Digital Credentials, and MUST contain a JSON object with the member `status_assertion_requests`.
The `status_assertion_requests` MUST be set with an array of strings, where each string within the array represents a Digital Credential Status Assertion Request object.

A non-normative example of Credential Proof of Possession is provided :ref:`in the previous section <credential_pop_jwt_ex>`.

**Step 2 (Status Assertion Request verification)**: The Credential Issuer that receives the Status Assertion Request object MUST validate that the Wallet Instance making the request is authorized to request Status Assertions. Therefore the following requirements MUST be satisfied:

- The Credential Issuer MUST verify the compliance of all elements in the `status_assertion_requests` object using the confirmation method contained within the Digital Credential where the Status Assertion Request object is referred to;

- The Credential Issuer MUST verify that it is the legitimate Issuer of the Digital Credential to which each Status Assertion Request object refers.

**Step 3 (Check for validity)**: The Credential Issuer checks that the User's attributes are not updated by the Authentic Source or that the latter has not revoked them. The technical mechanisms for obtaining this information are out-of-scope of this technical implementation profile. 

**Step 4 (Status Assertion Creation)**: The Credential Issuer creates the corresponding Status Assertion. When a Status Assertion is requested to a Credential Issuer, the Credential Issuer checks the status of the Digital Credential and creates a Status Assertion bound to it. If the Digital Credential is valid, the Credential Issuer creates a new Status Assertion, which a non-normative example is given below where the format is JWT.

.. code::

    {
    "alg": "ES256",
    "typ": "status-assertion+jwt",
    "kid": $ISSUER-JWKID
	}
	.
	{
		"iss": "https://issuer.example.org",
		"iat": 1504699136,
		"exp": 1504785536,
		"credential_hash": $CREDENTIAL-HASH,
		"credential_hash_alg": "sha-256",
		"credential_status_validity": true,
		"cnf": {
			"jwk": {...}
		}
	}

**Step 4 (Status Assertion Response)**: The response MUST include a JSON object with a member named `status_assertion_responses`, which contains the Status Assertions and or the Status Assertion Errors related to the request made by the Wallet Instance, as in the following non-normative example.

.. code::

    HTTP/1.1 200 Created
	Content-Type: application/json

	{
		"status_assertion_responses": ["${base64url(json({typ: status-assertion+jwt, ...}))}.payload.signature", ... ]
	}

The member `status_assertion_responses` MUST be an array of strings, where each of them represent a Status Assertion Response object as defined in `OAUTH-STATUS-ASSERTION`_.


Status Assertion HTTP Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The requests to the *Credential status endpoint* of the Credential Issuers MUST be HTTP with method POST, using the same mandatory parameters as in the :ref:`Table of Credential Request parameters <table_revocation_request_params>`. These MUST be encoded in ``application/json`` format.

      - `OAUTH-STATUS-ASSERTION`_ .

The *typ* value in the *credential_pop* JWT MUST be set to **status-assertion+jwt**

The *Credential status endpoint* MUST be provided by the Credential Issuers within their Metadata. The Credential Issuers MUST include in the issued Digital Credentials the object *status_assertion_requests* with the JSON member *status_assertion* set to a JSON Object containing the *credential_hash_alg* claim. It MUST contain the algorithm used for hashing the Digital Credential. Among the hash algorithms, the value ``sha-256`` is RECOMMENDED .


Status Assertion HTTP Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case of succesfully Status Assertion Request validation, the *Credential Issuer* MUST return an HTTP response with the status code set to 200. If the *Credential Issuer* is able to provide a valid Status Assertion for a requested Credential, the response MUST contains a Status Assertion object within a JSON Array. Otherwise, a Status Assertion Errors related to that Credential MUST be included in the Response JSON Array as an entry. 

If the Status Request fails (e.g. invalid request, server unavailability, etc.), an HTTP Error Status Code MUST be provided within the Status Assertion Response.

.. _sec_revocation_nra_presentation:

Status Assertion Presentation to the Verifiers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

During the presentation phase, a Verifier MAY request the Wallet Instance to provide a Non-Revocation Assertion along with the requested Credential. If a Verifier requests a Status Assertion for a requested Digital Credential, the Wallet Instance MUST provide the Status Assertions in the *vp_token* JSON array. If the Status Assertion is requested by the Verifier and the Wallet Instance is not able to provide it or it is expired or it is issued far back in time, the Verifier MAY decide to accept or reject the Credential according to its security policy.

Law-Enforcement Authorities or Third Parties authorized by national law, MAY require deferred non-revocation status verification but the definition of these protocols is currently out-of-scope for this technical implementation profile.
